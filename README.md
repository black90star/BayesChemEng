============


Matlab code for an effective inference method for analyzing costly experiments, often with multi-dimensional parameters multiple different settings (sets of design variables) and few repetitions.

This code is intended to accompany a manuscript in preparation. The link to the reference paper will be added, as well as a supplementary material with details of the algorithm. For inquiries in the meantime, please send an email to:

## Example scripts

We provide demo scripts to illustrate how the algorithm works.

### single dataset

* See `demo1_single.m` for a running example of iterative sampling algorithm, applied to a single dataset.

### multiple datasets

* (to be added)
